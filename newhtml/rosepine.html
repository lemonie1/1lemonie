          <div class="entry">
            <p>I might've made at least 20 different websites, and practically used none of them. All of them are beyond defunct. That is, until I was going through Neocities and found this layout. Sweet, short, simple.</p>
            <p>Now I give you <em>absolutely no guarantee</em> that I'm ever going to continue using this.</p>
            <p> Okay, so here's my introduction: I am an idiot + I like a shitton of things that keep changing. I like to call them arcs, because of the manga-sense of an arc and because it
              usually follows a shape like that, slow build up, climax, slow end. My arcs usually last a few weeks to a couple months, depending on how much I like the subject. Sometimes they
              repeat each other, like how I liked robotics, then stopped, then liked it again. Who knows why. 
              <br> <br>
              It's very hard to summarize myself in a few words but I'm an enjoyer of very niche
              stuff that looks coool and stuff. My 'core' interests are: preserving stuff, applying math to things I like (like Mario physics, Rubik's cubes, robotics etc), drawing, worldbuilding, video games,
              programming and a tiny bit of biology (I dig evolution, genetics and neuroscience). I <i> would </i> like to get into football but I'm the least athletic person I know. I REALLY like old stuff liked
              vintage cameras, Frutiger Aero and VHS tapes.
