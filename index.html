          <div class="entry">
            <p>I might've made at least 20 different websites, and practically used none of them. All of them are beyond defunct. That is, until I was going through Neocities and found this layout. Sweet, short, simple.</p>
            <p>Now I give you <em>absolutely no guarantee</em> that I'm ever going to continue using this.</p>
            <p> Okay, so here's my introduction: I am an idiot + I like a shitton of things that keep changing. I like to call them arcs, because of the manga-sense of an arc and because it
              usually follows a shape like that, slow build up, climax, slow end. My arcs usually last a few weeks to a couple months, depending on how much I like the subject. Sometimes they
              repeat each other, like how I liked robotics, then stopped, then liked it again. Who knows why. 
              <br> <br>
              It's very hard to summarize myself in a few words but I'm an enjoyer of very niche
              stuff that looks coool and stuff. My 'core' interests are: preserving stuff, applying math to things I like (like Mario physics, Rubik's cubes, robotics etc), drawing, worldbuilding, video games,
              programming and a tiny bit of biology (I dig evolution, genetics and neuroscience). I <i> would </i> like to get into football but I'm the least athletic person I know. I REALLY like old stuff liked
              vintage cameras, Frutiger Aero and VHS tapes.
            </p>

            <div class="title"> What am I like?</div>
            I would like to leave this to the people who know me best, but I can try to summarize myself a bit more.
            Online I'm probably more energetic and loud because I don't have to really worry about anything. I'm not very antisocial, in fact I quite enjoy talking to people in real life but I have a tendency
            to overthink and keep to myself in my apartment.
            <br> <br>
            -> I don't reallllly do MBTI but my type is <b> ENTP</b> <br>
            -> I have a weird tendency to REALLY hate oversatured stuff <br>
            -> I speak a LOT when I can <br>
            I do really weird stuff when nobody's watching, it's like a release of stored energy. <br>
            I also like doing random deep analysis of myself, like I was writing a guide to my brain at one point. <br>
